  Rome to heal a broken heart, where she ​confronts loneliness and intimacy,
  rage and desire.
book_description: >-
  Emilia arrives in Rome reeling from heartbreak and reckoning with her past.
  What was supposed to be a romantic trip has, with the sudden end of a
  relationship, become a solitary one instead. As she wanders, music, art, food,
  and the beauty of Rome's wide piazzas and narrow streets color Emilia's
  dreamy, but weighty experience of the city. She considers the many facets of
  her life, drifting in and out of memory, following her train of thought
  wherever it leads.\

  \

  While climbing a hill near Trastevere, she meets John, an American expat living a seemingly idyllic life. They are soon navigating an intriguing connection, one that brings pain they both hold into the light.\

  \

  As their intimacy deepens, Emilia starts to see herself anew, both as a woman and as an artist. For the first time in her life, she confronts the ways in which she's been letting her father’s success as a musician overshadow her own. Forced to reckon with both her origins and the choices she's made, Emilia finds herself on a singular journey—and transformed in ways she never expected.\

  \

  Equal parts visceral and cerebral, *Six Days in Rome* is an ode to the Eternal City, a celebration of art and creativity, and a meditation on self-discovery.

  - quote: “Sometimes it takes a three-thousand-year-old city to feel brand new.
      *Six Days in Rome* unfolds with all the crisp wonderment of a two-star
      hotel map. Sensorial as hell, it acknowledges the major landmarks and
      thoroughfares, but knows you have to get lost in the invisible, the
      unrendered to find what you didn’t know you were looking for. An ode to
      funky wine labels, good taste, and true inspiration, Francesca Giacco has
      penned a stunningly cool and stylish debut.”

      journeyed abroad to find themselves."'
